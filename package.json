  "description": "- Build a web based minesweeper game in 5 hours using your choice of technologies. - Ensure the game will run 100% in browser and does not require any backend code. All state needs to be in the browser (think in-memory or localStorage) - You should focus on making minesweeper functional and let the player control the size of the board and number of mines added - Extra credit make it look amazing, add sounds, show off your HTML wizardry  - Recommend you use jquery or raw HTML5/DOM.",
